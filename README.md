# MultiDBs-Vis-Server
Visualization

In this project, we need to visualize the data from the data sources registered in the MetaStore.

When users want to visualize the data, the first step is create a new canvas. Then users need to creat a new story in the canvas. Users are able to add datasets they want to visualize in the story. So basically, the story is like data source. After that, users are able to create charts for the datasets, such as pie charts, motion charts and so on. Charts are provided by using Google Chart API. Besides, users are able to search canvases by name and delete canvases. 

To implement these functions, we need to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and KnocoutJS for the interface design. And we need to use Java, RESTful API and Hibernate for the back-end design.
